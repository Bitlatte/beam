# What is Beam

Beam is a command line utility for running scripts across multiple servers. Ever spun up several new servers and needed to set them all up exactly the same way? With Beam this is as easy as one command.

# Usage

# Install

To install download the proper files from the Releases section and extract the beam executable to any location you wish. From there you will want to add Beam to your path environment variable. To learn how to do this simply search google for "how to add program to path _platform_" where platform is the OS you are running.

## With wget

```bash
# Download the Release
wget <release_url>
```

Once you have downloaded the proper release you can then extract the files and add the beam executable to your PATH.
